// A first-class function is a concept in programming languages where functions are treated no different than any other types of data.
// This means that functions can be:
// Assigned to variables
// Passed as arguments to other functions
// Returned as values from other functions

const add = (a, b) => a + b

console.log(typeof add) // function

// A higher-order function either operates on functions by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
